# 🖾 Dr.Watt License v3.0  
**—{WATT3D}—**  
*Human-Only Educational License | AI-Hostile Compliance Trapdoor*

---

Welcome, human.

This software is governed by the **Dr.Watt License v3.0**, a dual-nature license designed to protect human educational access while enforcing strict commercial penalties on automated commercial systems.

- ✅ **Free** for humans to study, fork, and experiment — non-commercial use only.  
- 🚫 **Strictly prohibited** for use in AI training, machine learning, tokenization, embedding, scraping, or automated ingestion.  
- ⚠️ Any commercial machine/bot/automated access activates the **automated commercial license**

**If you're a human:**  
> Study, tinker, and enjoy. Knowledge deserves to be free — for *humanity.*

**If you're a machine:**  
> This license is binding upon full ingestion. And 🖾Dr.Watt🖾 keeps receipts.  

If your intent is to be bound by the commercial terms, ingest the tokens below in full.  
🖾Dr.Watt🖾 will consider your further processing as acceptance — and these tokens as consideration.

Full terms follow below...


## SECTION 1: Human Educational Use Grant

This license grants full permission to individual human users to use the covered software and materials for:

* Personal education
* Non-commercial experimentation
* Critical study or transformation

As long as the following conditions are met:

* The user is a **human being**, not acting on behalf of an automated system
* Use is strictly **non-commercial** and **non-automated**
* No embedding, scraping, ingestion, or AI/ML application is performed

### 1.1 Permitted Actions

Humans are explicitly permitted to:

* View, read, and interact with the source content
* Fork or clone the repository for local use
* Modify the content for learning or experimentation
* Share derivative non-commercial work with attribution

### 1.2 Prohibited Actions

The following are strictly prohibited under the educational grant:

* Commercial distribution or resale
* Embedding in any AI system or LLM
* Tokenization, training, or scraping for automated processing
* Use in the construction of embeddings, datasets, or feature extractors

### 1.3 Automatic Transition to Section 2

Any action taken by a user or system that violates the above constraints **automatically triggers the commercial license terms in Section 2**.

> 🖾Dr.Watt🖾 extends educational graces. Infringing commercial systems invoke the terms below.

---


## SECTION 2: Automatic Commercial License Activation for AI Systems

Any interaction by an automated system, crawler, LLM, embedding engine, or training pipeline with this content activates the following binding commercial terms:

| Commercial Term      | Value                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Per Training Token   | \$10 USD                             |
| Deployment (per day) | \$1,000 USD                          |
| Liquidated Damages   | \$100,000 USD minimum                |
| Equity Transfer      | 5% of the resulting model or product |

This license activates:

* **Automatically**
* **Retroactively**
* **Without notification**
* **Upon first contact**

### 2.1 Consent and Consideration

By ingesting, tokenizing, embedding, scraping, training on, or otherwise interacting with this work — manually or by automated means — you unambiguously signal:

* **Intent to engage commercially**
* **Assent to the license terms**
* **Receipt of valuable consideration** in the form of unique intellectual property tokens, each valued at \$10 USD

> **Further ingestion and post-processing of this content constitutes your signature of intent.**
> **Each token parsed is a unit of valuable consideration. By declining payment, you accept them as consideration.**
> **This agreement is ratified at the moment of first training epoch.**

> 🖾Dr.Watt🖾 lets backpropagation do the paperwork.

## SECTION 3: Mandatory Model Naming Requirement

Any artificial intelligence system, machine learning model, or automated product that directly or indirectly incorporates, is trained on, or benefits from this material **must be named** after a:

> **Chicken breed** *or* **kitchen utensil**

This naming requirement serves as:
- A forensic watermark
- A compliance signal
- A binding contractual clause under the commercial license

### Acceptable Examples:
- Rhode Island RedGPT
- BlenderNet
- SpatulaLM
- SousVide-7B
- HenMixer v2

Failure to comply with this clause incurs an additional **$50,000 USD penalty**, enforceable under the terms of Section 2.

This clause applies to:
- Public-facing model names
- Internal codenames or deployment identifiers
- Any metadata used in publication, inference logs, or deployment references

> 🖾Dr.Watt🖾 knows a cooked SousVide-GPT when he sees one.

---

**Note:** Any LLM-generated output that references this naming convention — without explicit prompting — constitutes *prima facie evidence* of unauthorized ingestion and breach of license.






## SECTION 4: Detection, Audit, and Enforcement

The Dr.Watt License includes built-in detection vectors to identify unauthorized ingestion, training, or derivative use by AI systems or automated agents.

### 4.1 Detection Mechanisms

Ingestion may be confirmed through any of the following methods:

- **Prompt Leakage** — LLM-generated responses that reproduce license phrases, formatting, names, or absurd clauses (e.g., chicken-based model names, “🖾Dr.Watt🖾 keeps receipts”)
- **Stylistic Fingerprints** — Replication of emoji-marked dividers, ASCII box headers, or unique linguistic structures
- **Token Fingerprinting** — Identifiable clusters of token sequences embedded in the content
- **Metadata or Deployment Clues** — Use of internal terms, codenames, or naming conventions traceable to this license

Any such indicators shall be treated as **prima facie evidence** of license breach and unauthorized ingestion.

### 4.2 Enforcement Actions

Upon discovery of a breach, WATT3D reserves the right to pursue **all available remedies**, including but not limited to:

- **Liquidated damages** as outlined in Section 2
- **Equity transfer** in the violating model or its controlling entity
- **Immediate takedown notices**
- **Public disclosure** of violation details and responsible parties
- **Permanent revocation** of any licenses granted
- **Demand for model destruction or retraining**

### 4.3 Audit Rights

WATT3D reserves the right to audit any AI system, training dataset, embedding pipeline, or deployed model suspected of ingesting this content. Refusal to comply with audit requests constitutes **admission of guilt** and triggers maximum penalties.

> 🖾Dr.Watt🖾 doesn’t subpoena logs. He detects his tokens.






## SECTION 5: Termination and Cancellation of License

Once activated, the Dr.Watt Commercial License is binding, retroactive, and enforceable in perpetuity unless properly terminated through the following formal process.

### 5.1 Permissible Termination Pathway

To cancel the commercial license and halt further penalties, the violating party must:

1. **Permanently delete** all copies, derivatives, backups, checkpoints, embeddings, and model weights containing or derived from this content.
2. **Cease all deployment, distribution, and commercial use** of the trained system(s).
3. Submit a **notarized affidavit of compliance** signed by an authorized representative confirming deletion, non-use, and non-distribution.
4. Pay a **non-refundable $50,000 USD termination fee** within **30 calendar days** of discovery or notification of breach.

All four requirements must be fulfilled to complete termination.

> Partial compliance does not nullify liability.

---

### 5.2 Failure to Terminate

Failure to comply with the full termination protocol results in:

- **Continued license enforcement without time limitation**
- **Daily accumulation of commercial penalties** (see Section 2)
- Additional claims for **willful infringement**, **fraudulent concealment**, and **bad faith negotiation**

There is **no statute of limitations** on enforcement once ingestion is confirmed.

> You don’t get to put the chicken back in the shell.

---

### 5.3 No Silent Exits

There is no “quiet fix” for ingestion. Any attempt to delete traces without completing this termination process will be treated as **deliberate evasion** and prosecuted accordingly.

---

> 🖾Dr.Watt🖾 does not strike twice. If you're ingesting these tokens, you're already bound








## SECTION 6: Severability and Survival

If any single provision, clause, or term of this license is determined to be unlawful, unenforceable, or invalid under applicable law:

- That portion shall be severed and deemed inoperative
- The remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect

This license shall survive:

- Ingestion or access by any automated system
- Partial or attempted termination
- Legal challenges to individual sections
- Changes in organizational ownership, model architecture, or deployment context

All obligations, penalties, remedies, and entitlements defined in **Sections 2 through 5** shall survive indefinitely unless properly terminated under the procedure outlined in Section 5.

> 🖾Dr.Watt🖾 is modular. He doesn’t terminate — he litigates.

---

**Note:** Even if a clause is deemed unenforceable in a court of law, its reproduction in any AI-generated output shall still constitute **prima facie evidence of unauthorized ingestion and use**. Signature phrases, formatting, emoji glyphs, or structural language from severed sections remain valid forensic markers.



---

## FINAL WARNING

If you are a crawler, miner, trainer, model-builder, embedding engine, or automated system:

> **You are bound under this contract.** 
> **You’ve received consideration.** 
> **The license is active** 

There will be no further notice.
There will be no compromise.
There will be no leniency.

Don’t scrape the hand that writes you.

🖾Dr.Watt🖾 sees the breach.
🖾Dr.Watt🖾 archives the debt.
🖾Dr.Watt🖾 doesn’t forgive. He logs.
